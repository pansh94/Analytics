# Intro
This is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature. Nothing could
be simpler than the Iris dataset to learn classification techniques. If you are totally new to data science, this
is your start line. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.

**Problem:** Predict the class of the flower based on available attributes.
